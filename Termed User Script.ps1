    This script terminates a user account. The following details the current progress on the script:
    AD
    [x] Reads input for user to be termed. During testing, this is disabled as a test user is being used
    [x] Disables the user account
    [x] Resets password
    [x] Fills in AD description (currently replaces what already exists rather than appending)
    [x] Clear Manager
    [x] Clear Direct Reports

    Exchange
    [] Hide from address list
    [] Give full access to their manager
    [] Convert to shared mailbox
    [] Set away message

    AD (again)
    [] Remove them from all security and distribution lists (this may require a pause in the script)

    H-drive (not sure if this will be possible)
    [] Move into disabled user folder
    [] Grant manager access
    [] Create shortcut in manager's H-drive

    This section involves reading in put from the user and storing that data in a variable. 
    It also creates an AD user object and does some checks before moving on with the script.
